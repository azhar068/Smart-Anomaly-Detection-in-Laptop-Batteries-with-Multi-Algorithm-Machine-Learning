The comprehensive analysis of laptop battery anomaly detection demonstrates that the Isolation Forest model achieves near-perfect accuracy (100%) on the dataset, as reflected in its classification report and confusion matrix. The cross-validation F1 score of 0.987 further confirms the model's robustness and reliability in identifying both anomalies and normal batteries. Additional algorithms, such as One-Class SVM and DBSCAN, also show excellent performance, correctly classifying all samples. The predictive maintenance recommendations provide actionable insights, identifying batteries with unusual degradation and estimating remaining lifespan for healthy ones. These results collectively highlight the effectiveness of machine learning for proactive battery health monitoring and maintenance, supporting extended device reliability and optimized battery management.
